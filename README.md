# CronoDailies
November 2, 2019

**Use**:

1) Log in and roll for dailies on the site, https://www.chrono.gg

2) (Soon) Keep track of when new games are added to the coin shop and, upon new games being added, displaying a notification to the user.

TODO:

* Write detailed tests for the script

* Deal with Captcha (if possible...?)

* Incorporate elements regarding the coin shop

* Have alert for captcha solving handled more elegantly?

* Update for console args

Please feel free to provide any feedback in the issues tab on this repository.
